Querying Rockbusters relational database using advanced SQL techniques
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Data set used was provided by Rockbuster and contained the following datasets;
- payment, rental, store, film_actor, actor, inventory, film, film_category, category, customer, staff, address, city, country, language.
