1. Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

SELECT AVG(total_paid) AS average
FROM
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(B.amount) 
AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN payment B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON A.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule 
(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM (B.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_paid;

2. Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

SELECT DISTINCT (A.country),
COUNT (DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT (DISTINCT A.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id=B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id=D.address_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, E.country, D.city, 
SUM(B.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN payment B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON A.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule 
(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM (B.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers ON A.country=top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY A.country, top_5_customers
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
