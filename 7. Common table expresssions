Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

WITH average_total_paid_top5_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, 
city, total_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(B.amount) 
AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN payment B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON A.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule 
(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM (B.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_paid) AS average_total_paid
FROM average_total_paid_top5_cte;

2. Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

WITH top_customer_count_cte (amount, customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, 
country, total_paid) AS
(SELECT A.amount, B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, 
SUM(A.amount) AS total_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule 
(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.amount, B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC LIMIT 5),
customer_count_cte AS
(SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id)AS all_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country)
SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_customer_count_cte.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_customer_count_cte ON D.country=top_customer_count_cte.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
